## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Routing**: Wouter (client-side routing)
- **State/Data**: TanStack Query v5 for all server state
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + zod resolvers
- **Navigation**: Bottom nav bar (Home, Matches, Teams) — hidden on Match Details page

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express 5 on Node.js
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Schema Validation**: Zod with drizzle-zod integration
- **API Design**: REST endpoints

### Pages
- **Home** (`/`) — Dashboard with live/upcoming/recent match rows, quick action cards
- **Teams** (`/teams`) — Team list; click "+" to create a team
- **Team Details** (`/teams/:id`) — Roster management; add/delete players with name, jersey number, position
- **Matches** (`/matches`) — Match list grouped by Live/Upcoming/Results; click "+" to schedule
- **Match Details** (`/matches/:id`) — Live scoreboard, timer, event recording (sheet UI), event log, stats summary

### API Endpoints
- **Teams**: GET/POST `/api/teams`, GET `/api/teams/:id`
- **Players**: GET `/api/players?teamId=X`, POST `/api/players`, DELETE `/api/players/:id`
- **Matches**: GET/POST `/api/matches`, GET `/api/matches/:id` (includes events), PATCH `/api/matches/:id/status`

### Data Model
- **Teams**: id, name, shortName (3 chars), color

### Event Recording Flow (Match Details)
1. Start the match → timer starts, action buttons appear
2. Tap "HOME Action" or "AWAY Action"
3. Bottom sheet shows event type grid (Goal, Shot, Save, Assist, Turnover, Block, Yellow, 2min, Red Card)
